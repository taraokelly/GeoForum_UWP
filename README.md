## About

GeoForum is an Universal Windows Application that let's you anonymously converse with people in your area - 100,000 metres to be precise. GeoForum works by sending and retrieving forum post to the [GeoForumAPI](https://github.com/taraokelly/GeoForum_Backend) built with Express.js and MongoDB. The GeoForumAPI has been hosted on Heroku (sorry Damien). However, if you would like to download and run the backend yourself, follow the [user guide](https://github.com/taraokelly/GeoForum_Backend#user-guide). This project has been undertaken as an assignment assisting the learning of application development.

## Project Specification

Create a Windows 10 UWP App. The application should incorporate the following elements:

+ A responsive UI across the Windows 10 devices. There are some available for testing and
this includes the IoT core, mobile devices, tablet and PC. This includes Visual State
Management and using available SDKs for individual device types.
+ A UI that has been well designed and is fit for purpose. User Experience should be carefully
considered while developing the application. The User Experience should be consistent
across devices.
+ Mobile services for data storage and retrieval. The cloud service does not have to be written
in C# to be able to interact with a UWP. The preferred cloud to use is Azure.
+ Use of the MVVM design pattern in the development approach.
+ The app must be submitted to the Windows Store in order to be considered for marking.

## Features

+ Location based forum.
+ Anonymous posts.
+ Refresh capabilities.
+ Lazy loading.
